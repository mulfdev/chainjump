# Specification: Distributed Cross-Chain Order Processor (ChainJump)

#### System Overview
> A Rust-based distributed system for processing ERC-7683 compliant cross-chain orders, using registered workers to initiate orders on the source chain and execute on the target chain.

## Core Components

1. Worker Registry Contract (Ethereum)
2. Workers (Off-chain Rust services with ethereum EOA)
   - workers will need to stake 0.1 ETHER in order to be added to the registry
3. Coordinator (Off-chain Rust service)

## Smart Contracts

### Worker Registry Contract
- Manages worker registration with ETH deposit
- Initiates orders on the source chain
- Interacts with settlement contracts

## Rust Services

### Worker Service
- Async Rust application for order execution
- Interacts with blockchain contracts

### Coordinator Service
- Manages task distribution
- Maintains minimal local cache of active orders

## Cross-Chain Order Structure
- Implements ERC-7683 CrossChainOrder structure

## Core Workflows

### Worker Registration
- On-chain registration with ETH deposit

### Order Processing
- Round-robin task assignment
- Source chain initiation via contract
- Target chain execution by worker

## Data Management
- Primary Storage: Ethereum blockchain
- Local Cache: In-memory store for active orders

## APIs
- Order status / general order info (tx hash, etc)

## Misc

### Error Handling and Logging
- Comprehensive error handling
- Structured logging
- Focus on cache-blockchain consistency

### Testing and Deployment
- Rust-based testing
- Containerized deployment

### Performance and Scalability
- Async processing for concurrency
- Strategic caching to reduce blockchain reads
- Performance monitoring

### Security Considerations
- Secure key management
- Regular security audits
- API protection measures

### Future Considerations
- Worker reputation system
- Enhanced cross-chain security
- Multi-blockchain support
