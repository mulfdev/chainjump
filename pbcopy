Specification: Distributed Cross-Chain Order Processor (Cross Swap)

System Overview
1. A Rust-based distributed system for processing ERC-7683 compliant cross-chain orders, using registered workers to initiate orders on the source chain and execute on the target chain. The system leverages blockchain for primary data storage with minimal local caching.


2. Core Components
	2.1. Worker Registry Contract (Ethereum)
	2.2. Workers (Off-chain Rust services with ethereum EOA)
		- workers will need to stake 0.1 ETHER in order
		to be added to the registry
	2.3. Coordinator (Off-chain Rust service)


3. Smart Contracts
	3.1. Worker Registry Contract
		- Manages worker registration with ETH deposit
		- Initiates orders on the source chain
		- Interacts with settlement contracts


4. Rust Services
	4.1. Worker Service
		- Async Rust application for order execution
		- Interacts with blockchain contracts

	4.2. Coordinator Service
		- Manages task distribution
		- Maintains minimal local cache of active orders


5. Cross-Chain Order Structure
	- Implements ERC-7683 CrossChainOrder structure


6. Core Workflows
	6.1. Worker Registration
		- On-chain registration with ETH deposit
		- 6.2. Order Processing
			- Round-robin task assignment
			- Source chain initiation via contract
			- Target chain execution by worker


7. Data Management
	- Primary Storage: Ethereum blockchain
	- Local Cache: In-memory store for active orders


8. APIs
	8.1. Order status / general order info (tx hash, etc)
